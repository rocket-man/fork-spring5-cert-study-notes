# How does the @Qualifier annotation complement the use of @Autowired
```@Qualifier``` annotation gives you additional control on which bean will be injected, when multiple beans of the same type
are found. By adding additional information on which bean you want to inject, ```@Qualifier``` resolves
issues with ```NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException``` .

You can use ```@Qualifier``` in three ways:
- At injection point with bean name as value
- At injection and bean definition point
- Custom Qualifier Annotation Definition
